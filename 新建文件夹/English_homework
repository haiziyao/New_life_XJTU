  It's common knowledge that Paris kidnapped Helen, a move that enraged Menelaus and triggered the bloody Trojan War, with countless lives lost. But why did he pick Helen? Aphrodite holds a key part of the answer. At the Judgment of Paris, she tempted him by saying he'd get Helen, the fairest woman on earth, if he chose her for the golden apple.


If we dig deeper, Zeus's hand is in the mix. As the top god, he made Paris the judge in the beauty contest among Aphrodite, Hera, and Athena. This put Paris in the middle of the gods' power games.Also, Zeus's blatant exclusion of Eris, the infamous goddess of discord, from Peleus and Thetis's wedding served as the direct trigger that set off the Trojan War. Her act of throwing the golden apple in revenge set off a deadly chain reaction of rivalries among the gods

In myths, gods usually look like helpers, aiding humans in tough times. But in the Trojan War, their self - centered actions caused chaos. Their petty fights turned a simple kidnapping into a ten - year disaster. It shows that even gods, when greedy for power or consumed by pride, can bring great harm to humans.










It is a widely - acknowledged fact that Paris abducted Helen, an act that provoked Menelaus's fury and triggered the brutal Trojan War, in which countless lives were sacrificed. Nevertheless, a question lingers: why did Paris specifically choose Helen?

Aphrodite plays a pivotal role in answering this query. During the renowned Judgment of Paris, she seduced him with a promise: if he selected her as the recipient of the golden apple, he would win Helen, the most beautiful woman on the planet.

When we delve deeper into the matter, Zeus's involvement becomes evident. As the supreme deity, he appointed Paris as the judge in the beauty contest among Aphrodite, Hera, and Athena. This decision catapulted Paris into the heart of the gods' power struggles.

Moreover, Zeus's blatant omission of Eris, the notorious goddess of discord, from Peleus and Thetis's wedding acted as the immediate catalyst that set the Trojan War in motion. Her act of hurling the golden apple out of revenge set off a lethal chain reaction of rivalries among the gods.

In traditional myths, gods are often portrayed as benefactors, ready to offer a helping hand to humans in times of adversity. However, in the Trojan War, their self - centered conduct brought about chaos. Their trivial disputes transformed a simple abduction into a decade - long catastrophe. This situation clearly demonstrates that even gods, once ensnared by the ravenous hunger for power or overpowered by an overweening sense of pride, are capable of wreaking immense havoc upon humans.
